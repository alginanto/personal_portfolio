String about = '''
I first started dabbling in front-end development during my 12th grade year, creating React apps in my free time. This led me to discover Flutter, an exciting new framework I dove headfirst into learning. I landed my first internship as a Flutter developer while studying engineering in college. After honing my skills there for a year, I moved on to another internship with even more opportunities to grow.

Now, I work full-time as a software engineer at the company where I had my first internship. I thrive on crafting clean, structured code and pixel-perfect UI designs. Debugging and solving bugs is rewarding, since it expands my knowledge with each new solution.

When I'm not coding, you can find me going for runs to clear my head or chilling out watching movies. I also have a tendency to procrastinate more than I should!

Overall, I love creating smooth front-end experiences and writing code that makes me proud. I'm always looking for new challenges to help me grow as a developer.
